a brief description of your program 

Our program is inspired by the club penguin mini-game, Pizzatron. 
Our program runs entirely in the console of Python and relies on 
an ascii art interface. 

As the player “levels up”, more dictionary keys are unlocked. 

At the end, the program outputs a .txt file that gives the user 
some of their stats, including the user’s score and the last pizza 
they made.

instructions for running and testing your program 

The program can be tested by running the game in main.

functions correctly a description known defects or issues, if any

a brief description of the role you and your partner(s) played in 
completing the project. Who did what? How was the work distributed? 

Our work done in person together consisted of brainstorming ideas, 
pair programming, and rubber-ducking. We have multiple different python 
files that are imported into the actual working game, and the majority 
of the time we both worked together on the files simultaneously rather 
than asynchronously. This allowed us to solve problems and issues faster 
and improve our code more efficiently. 

We did a good job at talking through our code and making sure there were no 
problems, and if we couldn’t figure out how to code something, we talked 
through what we were trying to achieve and the other person would try and 
implement it into our program. 

We ran into some issues, such as trying to print things with special characters, 
but we quickly solved this issue using Stack Overflow and figuring out how to 
print the ASCII art without manually escaping each special character in the code. 

At first, we tried using the collaborative coding interface Replit, but we soon 
ran into problems using Replit (lag caused by cloud issues due to the collaborative 
editing process). We quickly changed plans and decided to pair-program on one 
computer within a local IDE.
